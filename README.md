Please note this very clearly: to any ex-friends who may attempt to follow me on this page, monitor my activity, or stalk me in any form, **I will find out**, whether through my friends informing me or through my own awareness. I am not unaware, naïve, or oblivious to repeated behavior patterns. If I recognize that you are engaging in stalking, monitoring, or unwanted attention toward me, I will take action immediately. This is not a threat, it is a boundary and a consequence.

I am genuinely exhausted from dealing with this behavior. The constant feeling of being watched, searched for, or tracked has made me feel unsafe and uncomfortable to the point where I no longer feel secure fully existing on social media. That is not normal, acceptable, or harmless. Social platforms should not feel like hostile environments where I have to be on guard at all times just to exist.

The fact that I have had to repeatedly abandon accounts, change names, and start over just to feel even a small sense of safety is honestly disturbing and frustrating. I should not have to keep doing this. No one should be forced to constantly relocate their online presence because others refuse to let go of past situations. The drama you are continuing ended **months ago**, and there is absolutely no justification for dragging it out through stalking or invasive behavior.

This situation has gone far beyond immaturity or curiosity, it is invasive, unhealthy, and unsettling. I am done tolerating it. I am choosing to protect myself, my boundaries, and my peace, even if that means taking strict action. If you genuinely want to move on and grow, the correct choice is to stop watching me, stop interacting with my spaces, and stop inserting yourself into my life entirely.

This is your warning and your closure. Respect my boundaries, or accept the consequences of not doing so.

### goodbye.
